# __more.tf__
 Website project for the game Team Fortress 2 and made using MERN stack. It makes connections between two commonly used websites as well as finding unprocessed player  information.
 
 This website gathers information that is sourced by 3 external calls;
  - logs.tf data api, this call is sent to "logs .tf/api/v1/log/log-id-here" with the log id given by player.
  - demos.tf search api, after the logs.tf response the data is used to find the demos.tf demo id.
  - logs.tf raw log file, zip file provided by a link for the raw log text file.
  
 Backend processes all of the responses, running through about 10,000 to 50,000 lines of text as well as 2 JSON responses that gets parsed to a single JSON return for the frontend.
